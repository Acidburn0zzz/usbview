version 0.8.1
	- fixed the Gtk-WARNING that happens the first time you press the
	  [Refresh] button.
	- sped up the device info display a bunch. Should work a lot better
	  for devices that have a lot of interfaces and endpoints.
	- fixed #ifdef bug in code. Thanks to Trond Eivind Glomsrød for
	  noticing this and providing a patch.
	- fixed improper speed display for low speed devices. Thanks to
	  Brad Hards for noticing this and prompting me to add support
	  for high speed USB (like there will not be other changes for
	  high speed when it happens...)

version 0.8.0
	- Added ability to select where the devices file is located at.
	  This allows you to view a usbdevfs devices file that comes
	  from another user, for instance. It also accomidates those who
	  do not mount usbdevfs at /proc/bus/usb.
	- Fixed bug with devices that have a lot of interfaces.
	- Changed the tree widget to a different style.
	- Restructured the internal code a bit nicer (a lot of work to
	  go with this...)
	- Added a TODO file to the archive listing some potential changes
	  that could be done.

version 0.7.0
	- the logic for determining the name of the device changed to 
	  properly display the name of a keyboard or mouse when the 
	  HID driver is used. This is needed for kernel versions 2.3.36
	  and up.

version 0.6.0
	- now can handle multiple root hubs.
	- added display of bus bandwidth information for root hubs.
	- added support for device strings to describe the device.
	- made logic for device name to be smarter due to the availability
	  of the string descriptors.

version 0.5.0
	- updated the parser to handle the fact that the interface now 
	  dictates what driver is loaded.
	- Tested on kernel version 2.3.29

version 0.4.0
	- redid the user interface slightly, making the tree always expanded,
	  showing the top of the text field, and better balancing the splitter
	  bar.

version 0.3.0
	- changed the parsing to make it easier to handle any future changes 
	  in the way the format of /proc/bus/usb/devices 

version 0.2.0:
	- Configuration, interface, and endpoint data is now displayed
	  for each device.
	- Fixed problem with processing the last line in the /proc/... file
	  twice.

Initial version 0.1.0:
	- devices are read from /proc/bus/usb/devices and put into a tree view
	- very basic information is displayed about each device when it is 
	  selected
